1. Make random wall generation 
	variable for Y randomizes coordinate in range of the field.
	check X from this cell
		if X - 1 || X + 1 == # then abort
			else generate a rnumber (max 5 for ex.)
				check Y + rnum 
					if there is a wall in one of those cells then abort
						else print a wall in all checked cells
/*it should also check sell rnum + 1 and if it is a wall then make sell Y + rnum empty*/
/*this is to avoid randomly closed and unreachable areas*/
